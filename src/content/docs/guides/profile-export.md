# How to export your profile

### Here is the list of steps you need to do.

  - First go to https://valkyriecoms.com/settings/preferences and find the import and export category
  - Second click the button that says Request your archive (make sure you are in Data export btw)

# Success

Congrats, all you need to do now is download your data archive (you might need to refresh the page for the button to show up)

Now you can import it into our new instance when that is deployed or any mastodon capable instance
